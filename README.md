# MangaDB
## What is it?
MangaDB is meant to have a simplistic approach to tracking and organizing your manga online. The current build serves as a simple CRUD app allowing users to add, edit, or remove manga from the list. However, future builds should offer a variety of features including usser authorization, custom created collections, and more advanced search/filter features.

## Notes
Most of the interactivity planned relies on user authorization. At that point, I will be able to create a more personal experience and be able to offer more unique features.
